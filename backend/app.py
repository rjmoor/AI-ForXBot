Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. 
Flask is called a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer and form validation. 
This file should create and run your Flask application. You need to import the create_app function from routes.py and use it to initialize the Flask app.

    app.run(debug=True)
    for rule in app.url_map.iter_rules():
        print(rule)
